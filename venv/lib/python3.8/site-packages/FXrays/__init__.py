"""
This package is a small, fast implementation of an algorithm for
finding extremal rays of a polyhedral cone, with filtering.  It is
intended for finding normal surfaces in triangulated 3-manifolds, and
therefore does not implement various features that might be useful for
general extremal ray problems.
